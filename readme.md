Attached is completed test game made with Phaser

I'm going to be expanding on this concept for this week, and will look into making a different kind of game next week.  Ultimately, I want to update the sprites and animations, and fix some of the animations that come with jumping. 

I also want to look into platform destruction.  The idea I have for my intro game is a bit like missle command, but instead of shooting missles, you must run around the screen collecting stars (or something of the like), which will regen the platforms that protect you from falling dangers.

First of all, I need to look into lives.

Then, I will look into spot-specific platform destruction (for when a falling object collides with the ground).  I want the overhead platforms to deteriorate as objects fall.

Next I will look into reconstituting the platforms, so that the player can collect items to keep himself alive.

Finally, I want to look into slowly increasing the speed of falling objects as you get better.  I'm thinking about doing this by score as opposed to time.  My reasoning would be so players could choose to start at a certain score limit (like in millipede) without having to play through the slower easier beginning of the game if they didn't want to.  But this would be a final feature, I reckon.

After all that is done, I'll tighten up the physics and the sprites.

And as always, porkchop sandwiches.
